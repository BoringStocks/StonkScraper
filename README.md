# __StonkScraper__
[See a live implementation here!](https://boringstocks.live/)

`StonkScraper` is a lightweight API that scrapes Yahoo's financial pages for a defined stock index. It is minimal by design but returns most of the data that the average daytrader would require to decide whether to buy or sell GME.

## Usage

Primary endpoint: `http://api.boringstocks.live/`

### Current Index Data
Request `http://api.boringstocks.live/v1/<stock_index>`<br>
`StonkScraper` returns a JSON containing these data points:
  - Current price
  - Range of historical data (not including the current day)
  - Market cap
  - Market status (open/close)
  - Opening price
  - Price change (points & percent)
  - Day's range (date, high, low, & close)
  - Index
  - Timestamp
  - Average volume
  - Volume

### Historical Index Data
`StonkScraper` can also return the historical data ending on the current date.<br>
Request `http://api.boringstocks.live/v1/<stock_index>/historical/<data_range>`
Desired Range | <data_range>
------------- | ------------
5 days | 5_days
1 month | 1_month
6 months | 6_months
1 year | 1_year
All historical data | max
